  <h1>Chapter 2: A Python Expert's Guide: Essential Tools and Techniques</h1>
  <h2>The Ode to Mythalogicursors</h2>
  <p>
    In the times of myth and Pyth’, a hero assembled a band,<br>
    Of warriors muscled and cursed, with knowledge both great and grand.<br>
    For their foe was a beast of knowledge, its fangs deep in the neural plane,<br>
    Their charge to defeat this menace, to unleash artifice on its brain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The leader of this daring group, of myth and mystery born,<br>
    Was Hercules, mighty and brawny, black Python scars adorned.<br>
    He'd study the <strong>NumPy trident</strong>, with powers vast and stark,<br>
    To calculate and transform, and light fireworks in the dark.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
import numpy as np

def fireworks_formula(x, y, t):
  return np.sin(x * np.pi) + np.cos(y * np.pi * np.exp(-t))

fireworks_formula(1, 2, 0.5)
  </pre>

  <p>
    With trident in hand, and Pandas staff on his side,<br>
    Hercules would wrangle data with ease, both far and wide.<br>
    Their knowledge of DataFrame manipulation, true and astute,<br>
    Hera herself was amused, at swift solutions so minute.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Hercules', 'Athena', 'Poseidon'],
        'Age': [32, 28, 49],
        'City': ['Thebes', 'Athens', 'Atlantis']}
        
heroes_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
heroes_df
  </pre>

  <p>
    Now with Heroes Assembled, their palette of tools endowed,<br>
    They honed their edge with TensorFlow and PyTorch, weapons unclouded.<br>
    Knowledge of tensors, like clay in their hands, on this battlefield of Keras fame,<br>
    They conquered deep learning's landscape, their foes vanquished in flame.
  </p>

  <pre>
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x.mean()

y.backward()
x.grad
  </pre>

  <h2>Upon the Summit of Mount Perceptron</h2>
  <p>
    With a tribe of divine tools, and techniques primed for the fight,<br>
    Their ascent to Mount Perceptron seemed endless, both day and night.<br>
    Networks woven, enchantments cast, by Python's ferocious might,<br>
    The dawning sun adorned their work, granting them Athena's sight.
  </p>

  <p>
    With seventeen labors before them, few dared stand in their way,<br>
    For in deep learning mathematics, their pythonic prowess would play.<br>
    Through activation and optimization, their wisdom would grow,<br>
    And in the annals of time, their legend would eternally glow.
  </p>

  <p>
    These tales of Herculean labors, in chapters hence be seen,<br>
    May they inspire your journey, through these realms so vast and clean.<br>
    Reach out for your NumPy trident and your Pandas' Staff of Light,<br>
    For then, like Hercules himself, you'll conquer deep learning flights.

  <h1>Code Explanation: Hercules' Labors in Deep Learning Mathematics</h1>

  <h2>The NumPy Trident: Fireworks Formula</h2>
  <p>
    In this epic, Hercules wields the powerful NumPy trident, a versatile tool for numerical calculations. Let's decode the fireworks formula represented by the NumPy trident:
  </p>
  <pre>
import numpy as np

def fireworks_formula(x, y, t):
  return np.sin(x * np.pi) + np.cos(y * np.pi * np.exp(-t))

fireworks_formula(1, 2, 0.5)
  </pre>
  <p>
    In this code snippet, we import the NumPy library and define a function called <code>fireworks_formula</code> that takes three arguments <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>t</code>. This function returns the sum of sine and cosine values, which are transformed through NumPy's mathematical functions. The formula represents a fascinating pattern, much like fireworks in the sky.
  </p>

  <h2>The Pandas Staff: Data Manipulation</h2>
  <p>
    Next, Hercules wields the Pandas staff for data manipulation. Observe the code below to learn how data is palmed like clay using the Pandas library.
  </p>
  <pre>
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Hercules', 'Athena', 'Poseidon'],
        'Age': [32, 28, 49],
        'City': ['Thebes', 'Athens', 'Atlantis']}
        
heroes_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
heroes_df
  </pre>
  <p>
    The given code snippet imports the Pandas library and creates a dictionary called <code>data</code> containing the fields 'Name', 'Age', and 'City' with relevant data. A DataFrame is constructed using this data, which makes it easier to manipulate and analyze the information. Displaying <code>heroes_df</code> showcases a tabular representation of the data.
  </p>  

  <h2>Tensors in PyTorch: Gradient Calculation</h2>
  <p>
    To conquer the deep learning landscape, Hercules engages PyTorch to mold tensors like clay. Let's dissect the PyTorch code snippet:
  </p>
  <pre>
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x.mean()

y.backward()
x.grad
  </pre>
  <p>
    The given code snippet imports the torch library, creates a 2x2 tensor and enables gradient tracking by setting <code>requires_grad</code> to <code>True</code>. We compute the mean of the tensor and store it in the variable <code>y</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, we invoke the <code>backward()</code> function to calculate gradients. Finally, we display the gradients associated with the <code>x</code> tensor by calling <code>x.grad</code>.
  </p>
