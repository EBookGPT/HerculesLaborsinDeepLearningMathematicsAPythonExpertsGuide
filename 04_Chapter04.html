<body>
    <h1>The Nemean Lion: Understanding Activation Functions</h1>
    <p>
        In the land of Neuralopolis, the great hero Hercules was tasked with
        his fourth labor, the fearsome Nemean Lion — a fierce creature
        guarding the treasure of deep learning knowledge. The lion's fur was
        impenetrable, and only by understanding Activation Functions could
        Hercules unchain the power to defeat this ominous beast.
    </p>

    <h2>The Magic of Activation Functions</h2>
    <p>
        Activation Functions are the magical spells that enable the
        neurons within a deep learning network to come to life. These spells
        cast their enchantments to transform raw inputs into meaningful
        outputs, allowing the network to adapt itself in pursuit of a desired
        outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        A simple example of an Activation Function is the Linear Function:
    </p>
    <pre><code>y = x
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        However, the Nemean Lion would not be so easily tamed. To unravel
        its mystery, Hercules would have to overcome more powerful
        enchantments.
    </p>

    <h2>The Sigmoid Spell</h2>
    <p>
        One such enchantment, the Sigmoid spell, was a famed Activation
        Function that could transform any number to a value between 0 and 1,
        perfect for binary classification:
    </p>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        But still, the Nemean Lion's roar echoed with growing resilience,
        urging Hercules to expand his mastery over Activation Functions.
    </p>

    <h2>The ReLU Enchantment</h2>
    <p>
        The ReLU Enchantment was Hercules' next weapon of choice. This
        powerful spell would take an input value and return it if it was
        greater than 0, otherwise providing 0 as the output:
    </p>
    <pre><code>def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        With newfound prowess in the ReLU Enchantment, Hercules advanced
        further. But the Nemean Lion's grip on the precious treasure was
        unyielding.
    </p>

    <h2>Defeating the Nemean Lion</h2>
    <p>
        Hercules realized that to slay the Nemean Lion, he must understand
        the strengths and weaknesses of different Activation Functions.
        Every enchantment had its domain, but no single spell could conquer
        all tasks alone.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong>Linear Function</strong> was suitable for regression
            tasks but lacked the capability to model complex patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Sigmoid spell</strong> excelled in binary
            classification but suffered from its vanishing gradient when
            numbers grew too large.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>ReLU Enchantment</strong> fastened the calculations
            within the network and allowed the construction of deeper
            architectures but presented dead neurons when negative input
            values appeared.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Acknowledging these intricacies, Hercules wielded the wisdom of
        Activation Functions, subduing the mighty Nemean Lion and securing
        the deep learning treasure. The hero's prowess had grown, but his
        journey had only just begun.

    <h1>Code Explanation: Resolving the Greek Mythology Epic</h1>
    <p>
        As Hercules conquered the Nemean Lion in our epic tale, three
        different Activation Functions were presented throughout the story to
        aid our hero. Let's unravel the code behind these mighty spells.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Linear Function</h2>
    <p>
        The Linear Function is a simple Activation Function used mostly in
        regression problems. In our story, it is not explicitly coded, but
        the function is represented as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><code>y = x
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This function states that the output <code>y</code> is equal to the input <code>x</code>,
        making it a straightforward linear transformation.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Sigmoid Spell</h2>
    <p>
        The Sigmoid Spell can transform any number into a value ranging
        between 0 and 1, making it ideal for binary classification problems.
    </p>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        First, we import the numpy library to facilitate the usage of
        mathematical functions. Second, we define the <code>sigmoid</code> function
        taking an input <code>x</code>. Finally, the function returns the output after
        applying the Sigmoid formula: <code>1 / (1 + exp(-x))</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. The ReLU Enchantment</h2>
    <p>
        The ReLU Enchantment is crucial in many deep learning architectures,
        as it efficiently handles negative input values and speeds up
        network computations.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        We define the <code>relu</code> function, which takes an input <code>x</code>. The function
        returns the maximum between <code>0</code> and the input value <code>x</code>. If <code>x</code> is
        greater than <code>0</code>, we obtain <code>x</code> as the output, while if <code>x</code> is
        negative or zero, we get the output as <code>0</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code used throughout our Greek Mythology epic exemplifies the
        application and utility of Activation Functions, showcasing the power
        they hold in the realm of deep learning.
    </p>
