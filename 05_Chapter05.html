<div class="chapter-title">Code Explanation: Hercules' Second Labor</div>

<div class="section-title">1. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</div>
<p>
  In the tale, Hercules learns about RNNs, which are commonly used for sequential data analysis such as natural language processing tasks. RNNs can be implemented with TensorFlow or Keras libraries.
</p>
<pre>
<code>import tensorflow as tf

# Define the RNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(128, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))</code>
</pre>

<div class="section-title">2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</div>
<p>
  Hercules also learns about CNNs, commonly used for image recognition tasks. CNNs can be implemented using TensorFlow or Keras libraries as well.
</p>
<pre>
<code>import tensorflow as tf

# Define the CNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=(img_height, img_width, channels)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_classes, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))</code>
</pre>

<div class="section-title">3. Regularization Techniques</div>
<p>
  In his quest, Hercules discovers regularization techniques to overcome overfitting, including L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.
</p>
<p>Here's an example code of how to apply L1 regularization in a Keras model:</p>
<pre>
<code>import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import regularizers

# Define a model with L1 regularization
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu", kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l1(0.01), input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_classes, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))</code>
</pre>

<p>Example code of applying the dropout technique:</p>
<pre>
<code>import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model with dropout
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu", input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_classes, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))</code>
</pre>

<p>Example code of using early stopping:</p>
<pre>
<code>import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Define a model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu", input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_classes, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the model using early stopping
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor="val_loss", patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping])</code>
</pre>

<div class="section-title">4. Optimization Algorithms</div>
<p>
  Hercules encounters the optimization algorithms like Adam and Momentum. These techniques can be effortlessly integrated into deep learning models using suitable optimizer classes.
</p>

<p>Example code of using the Adam optimization algorithm:</p>
<pre>
<code>import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu", input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_classes, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile the model with the Adam optimizer
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))</code>
</pre>
