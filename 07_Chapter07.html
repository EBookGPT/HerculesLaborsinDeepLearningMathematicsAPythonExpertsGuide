model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])</code></pre>
    <p>

    <h1>Code Explanation: Hercules' Third Labor &#8211; Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Our valiant hero, Hercules, equipped himself with the Python armor to defeat the mythical Hydra. Wrapped in the cloak of knowledge and wielding the sword of wisdom, he ventured forth to construct a powerful convolutional neural network. Let us now unravel the secrets that lay hidden within the code:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Importing the required libraries:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers</code></pre>
            <p>
                The first step in the creation of the Python armor was to import the necessary libraries. The <code>numpy</code> library facilitated numerical computations, <code>tensorflow</code> provided the deep learning framework, and the <code>layers</code> module from <code>tensorflow.keras</code> offered crucial building blocks for the neural network.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Creating the Sequential model:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>cnn_armor = tf.keras.Sequential([ ]) </code></pre>
            <p>
                Our hero chose to forge the sequential model in his anvil, wherein he could assemble the layers of the convolutional neural network in a linear fashion. The sequential model allowed for the smooth infusion of wisdom and power through each layer.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Defining the Convolutional Layers:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>    layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),</code></pre>
            <p>
                Within the armor, Hercules devised convolutional layers, wielding them as weapons to unearth hidden patterns within the images. Each layer contained its own filter, a powerful entity that roamed the pixel realms and focused on specific features. By carefully adjusting the kernel size and the number of filters, our hero optimized the convolutional layers' performance. The activation function, 'ReLU', provided a robust and efficient conduit for energy flow between input and output in the layers.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>The Power of Pooling:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),</code></pre>
            <p>
                Hercules harnessed the energy of the pooling technique to compress the information flowing through the convolutional layers. In doing so, he ensured that the armor was lightweight and nimble, capable of swift and precise maneuvers even as it analyzed the underlying features. By specifying the pool size, he could control the degree of compression and maintain a balance between computational power and efficiency.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Flatten the Features:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>    layers.Flatten(),</code></pre>
            <p>
                Upon uncovering the intricate features hidden within the dataset, Hercules used the <code>Flatten</code> function to transform the layered data into a linear format. This enabled smooth input into the subsequent densely connected layers that formed the armor's core.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Dense Layers:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')</code></pre>
            <p>
                Finally, Hercules forged the dense layers of the armor, crafting a vibrant web of interconnected neurons. This neural substructure facilitated the interpretation of image features and their subsequent classification into meaningful categories. Through the activation functions, 'ReLU' and 'softmax', energy flowed from input to output, heralding the victory of our hero against the Hydra of convolutional layers.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Each line of code crafted by Hercules held incredible power and wisdom, fusing together to form the Python armor that ensured his victory in the monumental third labor. Through trial and tribulation, our mighty hero forged a mighty convolutional neural network, unlocking the mysteries veiled within the realm of the deep learning universe.
