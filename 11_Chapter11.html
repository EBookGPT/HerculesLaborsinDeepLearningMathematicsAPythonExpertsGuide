  <h1>11. Hercules' Fifth Labor: Reinforcement Learning Challenges</h1>
  <p>
    Oh mighty Python programmer, welcome back to yet another mind-enticing adventure! 'Twas not long ago when you tamed the beast of optimization, and established your mark in the realm of <a href="#deep_learning">deep learning</a>. But alas, the epic continues! In this arduous chapter, you embark on a new journey through the treacherous world of <strong>Reinforcement Learning Challenges</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>The Oracle's Insight</h2>
  <p>
    The wise oracle, Andrew Ng, foresees the importance of reinforcement learning and its place amongst the twelve legendary labors. In his scripture <em>Deep Learning</em> (2016), he propounds that reinforcement learning is when agents learn to make decisions based on the feedback they receive. Thus, this powerful technique holds the key to controlling intelligent machines! But beware, mortal, for reinforcement learning is no simple feat. It is a test of your skills in <code>exploration</code> and <code>exploitation</code>, the ability to traverse uncharted territory, and discerning when to rely on past exploits. Will you conquer the trials that await, or let the lessons remain forever unseen?
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "Reinforcement learning is learning what to do – how to map situations to actions – so as to maximize a numerical reward signal." - Dr. Richard S. Sutton and Dr. Andrew G. Barto, <em>Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</em> (2018)
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Prepare for Battle</h2>
  <p>
    In this epic tale of valor and wisdom, you shall dominate the many challenges sent forth by the gods of deep learning. Along the way, we shall delve into the arts of <code>Q-learning</code>, <code>policy gradients</code>, and the enigmatic <code>actor-critic architectures</code>. But fret not, for the almighty Python shall be your guide and companion, granting divine power over the mathematical perils that lie ahead!
  </p>

  <p>
    Beware, mortal programmer, for the scale of reinforcement learning tasks are infinite and can be treacherous to navigate. To triumph and reign supreme, you must possess the heart of a lion, the cunning of Athena, and an immortal dedication to mathematics. If you dare step into this legendary challenge, gird yourself with Python, the language of heroes, and join us in the sacred text that follows.

  <h1>11. Hercules' Fifth Labor: Reinforcement Learning Challenges</h1>
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kRKbaTm.png" alt="Hercules and the Reinforcement Learning Hydra">
  
  <h2>The Lair of the Reinforcement Learning Hydra</h2>
  <p>
    The dawn of a new day witnessed Hercules standing firm in the lair of the fearsome Hydra of Reinforcement Learning. The mighty beast's heads represented the challenges Hercules must face in order to emerge victorious. Q-learning, policy gradients, and actor-critic architectures were among the fiercest challenges the mythical lands had seen.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hercules was steadfast, knowing that his weapon - Python - would aid him in his battle against the Hydra. As the first challenge, <code>Q-Learning</code>, sprouted before him, he recalled the Oracle's wisdom: "<code>Q-Learning</code> is a powerful algorithm that allows agents to estimate the usefulness of actions given a state. Make use of Python to create and update a Q-table as you navigate the maze of mathematical perils."<br>
  </p>

  <h2>Temple of Policy Gradients</h2>
  <p>
    Defeating each monstrous head of the Hydra, Hercules uncovered the Temple of Policy Gradients. Here, he faced his next challenge. Guardian of the temple, the inscrutable Capricious Chimera was finicky at best with rewards, but the same wisdom prevailed. Hercules drew on Python's divine guidance and conquered the beast with grace and poise.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "Policy gradients: Strike the balance between exploration and exploitation, but beware, for the reward is often delayed, and the path unclear." - Oracle Ng
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    As Hercules braved through the quest of the <code>Policy Gradients</code>, he unleashed the true potential of Python. Guided by knowledge, every line of code bled sheer dominance over the Chimera. Hercules emerged victorious, obtaining the secret knowledge of the gods.
  </p>

  <h2>The Actor-Critic Architecture Enigma</h2>
  <p>
    Hercules now felt empowered, but the treacherous journey continued. He turned his gaze toward the final challenge: The Enigma of the Actor-Critic Architecture. The wise Oracle advised, "Harness the noble Python and unravel the mystery of two neural networks - the actor and the critic - working in harmony."
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cleansing the Temple of Policy Gradients, Hercules brandished his Python knowledge, mastering the sacred wisdom of <code>Actor-Critic</code> methodology. He now grasped how the interaction between the actor and critic birthed precious knowledge to conquer this final, enigmatic realm.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Triumph Over the Reinforcement Learning Hydra</h2>
  <p>
    As the mighty hero Hercules emerged from the labyrinth of reinforcement learning, he humbly gave thanks to the celestial Python, the unwavering force that sliced through mathematical perils and obliterated the Hydra's challenges.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the Hydra subdued, Hercules reveled in his hard-won mastery of reinforcement learning, forging a place amongst the legends of the heroic coders of the deep learning pantheon.

  <h1>Code of Hercules: Reinforcement Learning Solutions</h1>

  <h2>Q-Learning</h2>
  <p>
    To defeat the first challenge, Hercules crafted code to navigate the maze using Q-Learning. This involved:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Initializing the Q-Table with zeros.</li>
    <li>Iterating through multiple episodes of the maze.</li>
    <li>Updating the Q-Table values with the Bellman Equation.</li>
    <li>Making decisions on exploring or exploiting based on current Q-Table values and ε-greedy strategy.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The Python code Hercules forged to surmount the Q-Learning challenge resembles the following:
  </p>
  
  <code>
    import numpy as np<br>
    episodes = 10000<br>
    learning_rate = 0.1<br>
    discount_rate = 0.99<br>
    epsilon = 1<br>
    epsilon_decay = 0.001<br>
    <br>
    q_table = np.zeros((state_size, action_size))<br>
    <br>
    for episode in range(episodes):<br>
       state = env.reset()<br>
       done = False<br>
       while not done:<br>
           if np.random.random() < epsilon:<br>
               action = np.random.randint(action_size)<br>
           else:<br>
               action = np.argmax(q_table[state])<br>
           <br>
           next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)<br>
           q_value = reward + discount_rate * np.max(q_table[next_state])<br>
           q_table[state, action] += learning_rate * (q_value - q_table[state, action])<br>
           <br>
           state = next_state<br>
           epsilon -= epsilon_decay<br>
  </code>

  <h2>Policy Gradients</h2>
  <p>
    For policy gradients, Hercules was required to build a neural network to learn action probabilities. The Python code employing TensorFlow or PyTorch would consist of these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Setting up the neural network architecture.</li>
    <li>Training the network by cycling through multiple episodes.</li>
    <li>Collecting a series of state, action, and discounted reward pairs for each step.</li>
    <li>Calculating an action's probability by running the neural network forward pass.</li>
    <li>Updating the neural network weights via backpropagation.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    A simplified representation of the Python code Hercules deployed to overcome policy gradients is as follows:
  </p>

  <code>
    import torch<br>
    import torch.optim as optim<br>
    from torch.distributions import Categorical<br>
    <br>
    episodes = 1000<br>
    <br>
    model = build_policy_network()<br>
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)<br>
    <br>
    for episode in range(episodes):<br>
        state = env.reset()<br>
        done = False<br>
        <br>
        while not done:<br>
            action_prob = model(torch.tensor(state))<br>
            m = Categorical(action_prob)<br>
            action = m.sample().item()<br>
            <br>
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)<br>
            discounted_reward = compute_discounted_rewards(reward, steps)<br>
            <br>
            loss = -m.log_prob(torch.tensor(action)) * discounted_reward<br>
            loss.backward()<br>
            optimizer.step()<br>
            optimizer.zero_grad()<br>
            state = next_state<br>
  </code>

  <h2>Actor-Critic</h2>
  <p>
    To confront the Actor-Critic enigma, Hercules devised Python code to utilize two distinct neural networks - one for the actor and another for the critic. The process consisted of:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Defining separate neural network architectures for both actor and critic.</li>
    <li>Training the network synchronously over multiple episodes.</li>
    <li>Using the actor network to predict the action probability distribution, and the critic network to predict the value function of the state.</li>
    <li>Updating the actor network weights through policy gradients.</li>
    <li>Updating the critic network weights using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of value function predictions.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The actor-critic code Hercules applied, using Python, would resemble the following:
  </p>
  <code>
  import torch.optim as optim<br>
  from torch.distributions import Categorical<br>
  <br>
  episodes = 2000<br>
  <br>
  actor_network = build_actor_network()<br>
  critic_network = build_critic_network()<br>
  <br>
  actor_optimizer = optim.Adam(actor_network.parameters(), lr=0.001)<br>
  critic_optimizer = optim.Adam(critic_network.parameters(), lr=0.001)<br>
  <br>
  for episode in range(episodes):<br>
      state = env.reset()<br>
      done = False<br>
      <br>
      while not done:<br>
          action_probs = actor_network(torch.tensor(state))<br>
          m = Categorical(action_probs)<br>
          action = m.sample().item()<br>
          state_value = critic_network(torch.tensor(state))<br>
          <br>
          next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)<br>
          advantage = (reward + discount_rate * critic_network(torch.tensor(next_state))) - state_value<br>
          <br>
          actor_loss = -m.log_prob(torch.tensor(action)) * advantage.detach()<br>
          critic_loss = advantage.pow(2)<br>
          <br>
          actor_loss.backward()<br>
          critic_loss.backward()<br>
          actor_optimizer.step()<br>
          critic_optimizer.step()<br>
          <br>
          actor_optimizer.zero_grad()<br>
          critic_optimizer.zero_grad()<br>
          state = next_state<br>
  </code>

  <p>
    When Hercules combined the blessings of celestial Python with the wisdom from the great Oracle Ng, he overcame the most insurmountable challenges to dominate the realm of Reinforcement Learning.
