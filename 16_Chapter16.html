    <h1>16. The Cretan Bull: <br />Advanced Regression Analysis Models</h1>

    <h2>An Epic Tale of Regression with the Mighty Andrew Ng</h2>

    <p>As Hercules approached the island of Crete, the air buzzed with the anticipation of his quest to tame the mighty Cretan Bull. Alongside him, the eminent sage Andrew Ng journeyed, eager to impart his wisdom of Advanced Regression Analysis Models. Together, they would unveil the layers of this powerful analytical tool, shaping the Python Expert's Guide to Deep Learning Mathematics.</p>

    <p>Upon reaching the shores of Crete, the duo spotted the fearsome Cretan Bull charging with persistence. Hercules and Andrew Ng decided to tackle this challenge head-on, employing the mystical language of mathematics to yield their desired outcome. The sage began by introducing the Linear Regression model:</p>

    <pre>
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    </pre>

    <p>Overcoming the initial step, they attempted to improve their accuracy by incorporating the powerful art of Regularization. Glancing at Andrew Ng for wisdom, the Python code for Ridge Regression came to life:</p>

    <pre>
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    </pre>

    <p>And as Hercules grappled the great beast, Andrew Ng bestowed upon him another secret: Lasso Regression. With newfound vigor, the code formed before their very eyes:</p>
    
    <pre>
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

model = Lasso(alpha=1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    </pre>

    <p>Finally, with the culmination of wisdom in Regression Analysis Models and the brilliant guidance of Andrew Ng, Hercules successfully tamed the furious Cretan Bull. They emerged victorious, their mathematical prowess amplified with each Python code and deep learning technique they conquered.</p>

    <p>And so, our fearless Python experts, this epic tale brings us one step closer to complete mastery of the mathematics lying deep within the heart of deep learning. Together, with the wisdom of the ancient Greeks and the modern genius of Andrew Ng, we shall ride alongside Hercules, vanquishing the challenges that lie ahead and revealing the beauty of the path we've chosen.</p>

    <h1>Explanations: Advanced Regression Analysis Models</h1>

    <h2>Understanding the Code from the Epic Tale</h2>
    <p>In our mythical tale, three advanced regression models were utilized to tame the mighty Cretan Bull. We shall now unravel each model's code to sharpen our understanding of these mathematical techniques.</p>

    <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>Our first step involved the use of the Linear Regression model. The code snippet can be summarized as follows:</p>
    
    <pre>
1. Import necessary modules:
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

2. Create and fit the Linear Regression model:
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

3. Predict the output and calculate the mean squared error (MSE):
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    </pre>

    <p>Linear Regression aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. By fitting a straight line to a dataset, it seeks to minimize the mean squared error.</p>

    <h2>Ridge Regression</h2>
    <p>Next, we delved into Ridge Regression, a technique that implements L2 regularization to improve the linear regression model's performance. The code steps are as follows:</p>
    
    <pre>
1. Import the Ridge Regression module:
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

2. Create and fit the Ridge Regression model with an alpha value of 1.0:
model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

3. Predict the output and calculate the mean squared error (MSE):
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    </pre>

    <p>Ridge Regression introduces a regularization term that adds a penalty proportional to the square of the coefficients. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training dataset, resulting in more accurate predictions.</p>

    <h2>Lasso Regression</h2>
    <p>Finally, we ventured into Lasso Regression, a model that employs L1 regularization. The code steps for this model are as follows:</p>
    
    <pre>
1. Import the Lasso Regression module:
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

2. Create and fit the Lasso Regression model with an alpha value of 1.0:
model = Lasso(alpha=1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

3. Predict the output and calculate the mean squared error (MSE):
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    </pre>

    <p>Lasso Regression also adds a penalty term to reduce overfitting. However, it employs a different regularization term, which is proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients. This may lead to some coefficients being exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection.</p>

    <p>By understanding and masterfully applying these advanced regression analysis models, the mighty Hercules ultimately triumphed over the Cretan Bull. With this mathematical wisdom as our guide, we too shall conquer the epic journey to Deep Learning Mathematics mastery.</p>
