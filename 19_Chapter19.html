    <h2>Part I: The Bayesian Awakening</h2>
    <p>As the fiery sun set across the horizon and dusk spread its cloak upon the azure sky, Hercules was summoned to the temple of the wise Oracle. Here, he would receive the knowledge to surmount the monumental Ninth Labor: delving into the complexities of Bayesian Deep Learning.</p>
    <p>The Oracle implored Hercules:</p>
    <p class="quote">"To conquer this challenge and achieve great wisdom, you must awaken the powers of Bayesian optimization, an approach that balances exploration and exploitation."</p>
    <h3>Bayesian Optimization</h3>
    <p>And so, Hercules embarked on the path to the fabled world of Bayesian optimization, a technique that enabled him to optimize complex functions with minimal evaluations. He discovered that its foundation was rooted in modeling functions using <code>Gaussian Process (GP)</code>, and a famed acquisition function such as Expected Improvement (EI).</p>
    <p>Hercules then strived to apply Bayesian optimization to the realm of Deep Learning, where he would navigate hyperparameters and enhance model selection.</p>

    <h2>Part II: The Fellowship of Libraries</h2>
    <p>Hercules, however, did not undertake this journey alone. Accompanying him were three powerful allies: the versatile <code>PyMC3</code>, the steadfast <code>TensorFlow Probability</code>, and the adaptive <code>Keras</code>. Harnessing their collective strength, they embarked on the quest for Bayesian enlightenment.</p>
    <h3>PyMC3</h3>
    <p>Knowing he had the skillful PyMC3 at his side, Hercules became adept at creating probabilistic models with ease, and sampled them using modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, like the illustrious No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).</p>
    <h3>TensorFlow Probability</h3>
    <p>TensorFlow Probability -- Hercules' guide through the mists of Bayesian uncertainty -- elegantly offered statistical tools and techniques, enabling our hero to unravel and conquer TensorFlow-based Bayesian models.</p>
    <h3>Keras</h3>
    <p>Keras, the incarnation of flexibility and simplicity, provided Hercules with high-level building blocks to construct neural networks. Its profound compatibility with PyMC3 and TensorFlow Probability granted Hercules divine capabilities in Bayesian Deep Learning.</p>

    <h2>Part III: The Art of Bayesian Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>With the Oracle's wisdom resonating in his spirit, and the companionship of his three allies, Hercules learned to integrate Bayesian logic with deep learning, creating a symbiotic relationship that paved the way for the mastery of Bayesian Neural Networks.</p>
    <p>Through the use of Bayesian principles in the neural network, Hercules discovered the means to quantify model uncertainty, estimate multiple outputs from given inputs, and reap the rewards of probabilistic interpretations.</p>
    <p class="quote">"One must not fear the uncertainty but instead harness its potential, for therein lies the path to true Bayesian mastery." - Hercules, Champion of Probabilistic Wisdom</p>

    <h2>Epilogue: Victory and Enlightenment</h2>
    <p>The Ninth Labor of Bayesian Deep Learning lay vanquished before Hercules, as he assimilated the intricate knowledge gleaned from this epic journey. Like the hero of yore, dear readers, you too can conquer this challenge and command the intricate art of Bayesian Deep Learning through courage and determination.</p>
    <p>As the curtain falls upon this chapter of Hercules' tale, heed the guidance of the Oracle and sharpen your skills with PyMC3, TensorFlow Probability, and Keras, in the hallowed domain of Bayesian optimization, model selection, and uncertainty quantification. The wisdom of Hercules shall now be your own.</p>

    <h2>Code Insights: Taming the Bayesian Beast</h2>
    <p>Dearest reader, we shall now explore the exemplary code snippets that aided Hercules in overcoming the challenge of the Ninth Labor: Bayesian Deep Learning.</p>

    <h3>PyMC3: The Prudent Prophet</h3>
    <p>With the aid of the mighty PyMC3, Hercules harnessed the power of probabilistic programming to define probabilistic models, specifying priors and likelihoods. Using these, he sampled the posterior distribution to gain valuable insights.</p>
    <p>Witness these sacred lines of code:</p>
    <pre><code>import pymc3 as pm

with pm.Model() as model:
    prior = pm.Normal("prior", mu=0, sigma=1)
    likelihood = pm.Normal("likelihood", mu=prior, sigma=1, observed=observed_data)
    trace = pm.sample(1000)
</code></pre>

    <h3>TensorFlow Probability: The Protector of Probabilities</h3>
    <p>Through the arcane knowledge of TensorFlow Probability (TFP), Hercules extended his TensorFlow models and bounded them with the chains of uncertainty. See for yourself the enchanting incantations he penned:</p>
    <pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1),
    tfp.layers.DistributionLambda(lambda t: tfd.Normal(loc=t, scale=1))
])
</code></pre>

    <h3>Keras and Bayesian Neural Networks: A Mythic Alliance</h3>
    <p>Unifying Keras and Bayesian principles, Hercules forged the invincible Bayesian Neural Network. This formidable creation encapsulated the ability to perceive uncertainty, empowering Hercules to delve even deeper into the depths of Deep Learning.</p>
    <p>Behold the alchemical synthesis:</p>
    <pre><code>import pymc3 as pm
import theano.tensor as tt

def construct_bnn(prior_scale, input_dim):
    n_hidden = 64

    with pm.Model() as neural_network:
        prior_mu = np.zeros(n_hidden)
        prior_sigma = np.ones(n_hidden) * prior_scale

        weights_in = pm.Normal('w_in', mu=prior_mu, sigma=prior_sigma, shape=(input_dim, n_hidden))
        weights_out = pm.Normal('w_out', mu=prior_mu, sigma=prior_sigma, shape=(n_hidden,))

        a = pm.math.tanh(pm.math.dot(pm.Data('X', X_data), weights_in))
        act_out = pm.math.dot(a, weights_out)

        out = pm.Normal('out', mu=act_out, sigma=noise_sigma, observed=observed_data)

    return neural_network
</code></pre>

    <p>Through the sublime union of code and myth, Hercules emerged victorious in his Ninth Labor. O noble reader, may his victorious journey inspire you to triumph over the intricate realm of Bayesian Deep Learning.</p>
