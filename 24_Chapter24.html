        <li>Hypothesis testing: Identifying the influence of individual apple strains upon the overall harvest.</li>
        <li>Feature importance: Uncovering the true determinants behind an apple's divine properties.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As we delve into each application, guided by the wisdom of the skillful Python programming language, we will strengthen our understanding of Gradient Boosting and find new ways to harness its immense computational prowess. As the tale unfurls, the incorporated code samples will both illuminate and elucidate the concepts being explored, enriching our understanding of the mighty Gradient Boosting and its applications.</p>
