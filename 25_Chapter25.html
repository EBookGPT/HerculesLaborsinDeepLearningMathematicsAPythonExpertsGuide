    <h1>25. Hercules' Twelfth Labor: Deep Learning Mathematics Mastery</h1>
    <p>
        <span class="dropcap">W</span>hispers of a potent force spread across the realm of Olympusâ€”Rumor spoke of an unparalleled statistical power, born from the elegant loom of mathematical synergy. But, a formidable trial stood between mighty Hercules and the secrets of deep learning mathematics mastery. Thus, he sought the guidance of the venerable sage, <span class="author">Yoshua Bengio</span>, a titan amongst mortal scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Great Bengio, renowned master of Deep Learning, lend me your wisdom in this arduous pursuit! My journey toward ultimate computational might yet lacks completion," beseeched Hercules.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heeding the hero's plea, Bengio wove a tantalizing tale of linear algebra, daring Hercules to unravel the mysteries of matrix manipulations.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix Multiplication
C = np.dot(A, B)</pre>
    <p>
        Calculus soon revealed itself, summoning Hercules to tame unruly differentials and dance with the oft capricious beasts of integration.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
from sympy import symbols, diff, integrate

x = symbols('x')

# Differentiating a function
y = x**2 + 2*x + 1
dy = diff(y, x)

# Integrating a function
integral_y = integrate(y, x)</pre>
    <p>
        The final gatekeeper, Probability, demanded the hero decode her cryptic messages, challenging Hercules to bend randomness and uncertainty to his will.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
import random

# Simulating dice roll
num_trials = 10000
desired_result = 0

for _ in range(num_trials):
    roll = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6)
    if roll == 7:
        desired_result += 1

probability = desired_result / num_trials</pre>
    <p>
        Together, Hercules and Bengio wrestled these mathematical Gorgons to the ground, their triumph echoing through the halls of Mount Olympus. United, they imparted the knowledge of deep learning to eager disciples, unlocking an era of boundless insight and inconceivable innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their legacy shall endure in the annals of legend, as the courageous scholars who defied the unknown, mastered the mathematics, and forged a path for the triumphant heroes of tomorrow.

    <h1>Code Explanations: Mastering the Deep Learning Mathematics</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Taming the Matrix with Linear Algebra</h2>
    <p>
        The first step of Hercules' deep learning maths journey involved taming the matrix, a key element of linear algebra. In the given code snippet, two matrices A and B were created using the Python package NumPy. A matrix multiplication, resulting in a new matrix C, was then performed using the dot function.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix Multiplication
C = np.dot(A, B)</pre>

    <h2>2. Dancing with Calculus</h2>
    <p>
        The second trial on Hercules' path to mathematical mastery entailed dancing with the enchanting forms of differentiation and integration, both crucial components of calculus. The Python package SymPy was employed to symbolically differentiate and integrate a given function, y. The resulting derivative, dy, and integral, integral_y, were then calculated through SymPy's diff and integrate functions, respectively.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
from sympy import symbols, diff, integrate

x = symbols('x')

# Differentiating a function
y = x**2 + 2*x + 1
dy = diff(y, x)

# Integrating a function
integral_y = integrate(y, x)</pre>

    <h2>3. Deciphering Probability's Secrets</h2>
    <p>
        Probability emerged as the final challenge before Hercules, its secrets obscured by stochastic enigma. To conquer this realm, a simple simulation was constructed to estimate the probability of rolling a 7 with two standard 6-sided dice. Over 10,000 trials, each dice was rolled and their values summed. The number of 7s cast was divided by the total number of trials, ultimately yielding a close approximation of the desired probability.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
import random

# Simulating dice roll
num_trials = 10000
desired_result = 0

for _ in range(num_trials):
    roll = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6)
    if roll == 7:
        desired_result += 1

probability = desired_result / num_trials</pre>
    
    <p>
        Conquering each mathematical domain, Hercules and Bengio prevailed, etching their mastery into legend by resolving the challenges of matrices, calculus, and probabilities. Through these code explanations, the arcane power of deep learning mathematics was at last revealed, tamed by the will of the indomitable hero.
