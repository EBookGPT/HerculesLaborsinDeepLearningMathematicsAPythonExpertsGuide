<h2>1. Gated Recurrent Units: Apollo's Prophecy</h2>
<p>Twas in the golden age of ancient Greece, when knowledge flowed like honeyed ambrosia. Unto Hercules did Apollo bequeath a cryptic prophecy—<b>Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)</b>—whose portents would echo through eternity.</p>
<code>
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf</code>
<p>And there, in the hallowed halls of knowledge, our hero did summon the power of Python to illuminate the wisdom of GRUs. The gates – forged by Apollo's own hand – unveiled a world where past and present coalesce.</p>
<code>
class GRU:
    def __init__(self, ...):</code>
<h2>2. LSTM Networks: The Labyrinth of Time</h2>
<p>Amidst the haze of uncertainty, a labyrinth materialized—a winding maze of temporal complexity, guarded by an enigmatic sentinel: <b>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks</b>.</p>
<code>
from keras.preprocessing import sequence
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM</code>
<p>With courage, Hercules harnessed the might of Python, delving into the mysteries of LSTMs. Shedding light on memory cells and sequential miracles, the hero unveiled the hidden paths within.</p>
<code>
def build_lstm_model(input_shape, ...):
    model = Sequential()

<code>
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
from keras.models import Model</code>
<p>Guided by the cryptic verses bestowed upon him by the muse of Python, Hercules deftly traversed the ethereal plane.</p>
<code>
input_img = Input(...)
encoded = Dense(..., activation='relu')(input_img)
decoded = Dense(..., activation='sigmoid')(encoded)
autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)</code>
<h2>4. Variational Inference: Poseidon's Prophetic Plunge</h2>
<p>A storm raged above, angered oceans swelling at the behest of Poseidon. Amidst the turmoil, the sea god whispered of the hallowed truths of <b>Variational Inference</b>.</p>
