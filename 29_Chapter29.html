<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:2.5em; margin-top:40px;">Hercules and the Multilayer Perceptron</h1>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">In the annals of Greek Mythology, a tale of knowledge and mastery has been passed down through the generations. One fine day, Pythia, the legendary Oracle of Delphi, foretold of a mighty hero tasked with uncovering the secrets of the Basic Structure and Implementation of the Multilayer Perceptron—a complex device known to bridge the realms of gods and humans alike.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">"Hercules, son of Zeus, you shall decipher the enigmatic structure of this untamed beast! The oracle has spoken, and so begins your tireless quest with this monumental Labor!" roared Hera, his doting stepmother with sardonic fervor.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">And thus, Hercules embarked on his daunting journey, traversing through the mysterious lands of the artificial neural networks. Legend has it that he was guided by the spirit of Python himself.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">The First Key: Understanding the Basic Structure</h2>
    
    <p>Our valiant hero, Hercules, discovered the first key to unraveling the mystery of the Multilayer Perceptron: understanding its basic structure.</p>

    <p>With a steadfast heart, Hercules sought the guidance of the mathematics gods:

<pre style="background:#f4f4f4; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-left: 3px solid #f36d33; padding:1em; white-space: pre-wrap;">  
Let us start with 𝑥: the input vector
               𝑊: the weight matrix thereof
           𝑧 = 𝑓(𝑋,𝑊): the activation value post-linear transformation
     activ. value: <b>𝑓</b>our non-linear function

</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #ddd; padding:20px; margin-top:20px; background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.6);">
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Second Key: Mastering the Implementation</h2>
    
    <p>Wielding the first key to mastering the Multilayer Perceptron, Hercules ventured forth in search of the second key: the art of implementation. As he laid his hands on the ancient scrolls inscribed with the ways of Python, our hero began to discern the language of the gods:

<pre style="background:#f4f4f4; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-left: 3px solid #f36d33; padding:1em; white-space: pre-wrap;">
<code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class MultilayerPerceptron:
    def __init__(self, layers):
        self.layers = layers
        self.weights = []

    def train(self, X, y, eta, n_epochs):</code>
    ... More Python magic here ...
</pre>
    </p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">Hercules' daunting quest had led him to the crux of this Herculean Labor. He worked tirelessly to unravel the secrets of the Multilayer Perceptron's basic structure and implementation, wooing the gods with his ardent pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>At last, his journey had come to an end. Our hero had conquered the enigmatic beast that was the Multilayer Perceptron. The wisdom of Python had prevailed and the divine mathematics of the neural networks were now at Hercules' beck and call!</p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:40px;">
    <span style="font-size:1.4em;">The Oracle's prophecy was now fulfilled!</span><br>

<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size: 2.5em; margin-top: 40px">Decoding the Pythonic Code of Hercules' Epic Labor</h1>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">As Hercules triumphed over the seemingly insurmountable labor of deciphering the Multilayer Perceptron, he forged an everlasting bond between divine mathematics and the art of god-like code. Let us endeavor to uncover the meaning behind the mystical Python code and its role in the resolution of our epic Greek Mythology tale.</p>


<div style="border:1px solid #ddd; padding:20px; margin-top:20px; background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.6);">
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Understanding the Python Code</h2>
    
    <p>The multifaceted code our hero utilized contains a magnificent implementation of the Multilayer Perceptron. Together, let us dissect its components and unveil its secrets:</p>
    
    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">1. Importing Libraries:</h3>
    <p>Just as Hercules relied on spells and divine tools to vanquish his foes, the code invokes Python's libraries to provide essential functions:</p>
    <pre style="background:#f4f4f4; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-left: 3px solid #f36d33; padding:1em; white-space: pre-wrap;">
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    </pre>
    
    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">2. Defining the MultilayerPerceptron Class:</h3>
    <p>The code defines a class, <code>MultilayerPerceptron</code>, harnessing the fundamental structure and methods to create a Multilayer Perceptron model, akin to Hercules constructing his strategy. The class requires two primary methods:</p>
    <pre style="background:#f4f4f4; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-left: 3px solid #f36d33; padding:1em; white-space: pre-wrap;">
class MultilayerPerceptron:
    def __init__(self, layers):
        self.layers = layers
        self.weights = []

    def train(self, X, y, eta, n_epochs):
      …
    </pre>

    <ul>
      <li><b>__init__:</b> This initializer method defines the structure by storing the number of layers and initializing an empty list of the weights.</li>
      <li><b>train:</b> The training method incorporates input data (<code>X</code>), target labels (<code>y</code>), learning rate (<code>eta</code>), and the number of training epochs (<code>n_epochs</code>) to instruct the Multilayer Perceptron model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">3. Training the Perceptron:</h3>
    <p>As Hercules journeyed through the layers of knowledge, so too the code trains the perceptron using various techniques. Though the methods revealed in the epic were incomplete, our hero would have likely used forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight adjustment to achieve his quest.</p>

</div>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">By delving into the Python code, we have unlocked the arcane knowledge possessed by Hercules. This newfound understanding empowers us to implement the Multilayer Perceptron and further our quest, just like the mighty hero of our Greek Mythology tale!</p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:40px;">
    <span style="font-size:1.4em;">Revel in Hercules' victory!</span><br>
    <span style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight:bold;">And harness the power of Python code!</span>
